## 🧩 How It Works

1. The user selects a conversation role (e.g., Job Interviewer).
2. The AI begins a role-specific conversation using structured prompting.
3. The user responds in natural language.
4. After several exchanges, the system analyzes the user’s responses.
5. AI generates detailed, structured feedback to help the user improve.

This project focuses on combining **conversational AI** with **performance coaching**, turning a chatbot into a practical training tool.
